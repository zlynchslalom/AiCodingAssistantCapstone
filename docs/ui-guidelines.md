# Chess Web App UI Guidelines

## 1. Visual Style
- Use a classic chessboard look with traditional piece designs.
- Board squares should be styled in Seattle Seahawks colors:
  - Dark squares: Deep navy blue (#002244)
  - Light squares: Bright green (#69BE28)
  - Accent colors: Silver (#A5ACAF) and white (#FFFFFF) for borders, highlights, and UI elements
- Chess pieces should be easily distinguishable, using white and navy blue for piece colors.

## 2. Color Mode
- Provide a toggle for light and dark mode within the app UI.
- Default to dark mode (navy blue background) for a classic feel.
- Ensure all UI elements (buttons, panels, move highlights) adapt to the selected mode.

## 3. Animations
- Animate piece movements for a smooth, engaging experience.
- If performance issues arise, use simple transitions (fade or slide) for piece changes.
- Highlight the last move with a subtle animation or border.

## 4. Accessibility
- Accessibility is a future goal; current UI will focus on visual clarity and usability for desktop users.

## 5. Platform Priority
- Prioritize desktop layout and interactions.
- Responsive design is optional for initial release; mobile support can be added later.

## 6. Branding
- Use Seattle Seahawks color palette for all UI elements.
- Incorporate Seahawks-inspired fonts and icons where appropriate.
- Optionally, add a Seahawks logo or theme in the app header.

## 7. UI Elements
- Clear, intuitive controls for move selection, undo/redo, and game management.
- Move history and captured pieces displayed in side panels.
- Minimal clutter; focus on chessboard and essential controls.
